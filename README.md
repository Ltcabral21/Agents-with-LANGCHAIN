Agents powered with LANGCHAIN



  -Description-
  
Welcome to Agents powered with LANGCHAIN! This project uses the OpenAI API to create intelligent agents that interact with a SQL database, efficiently returning relevant information in an automated manner. In other words, it's a superpower in code form, designed to amaze you with what artificial intelligence can do!\

-Installation-

Installing the project is as simple as following the steps on GitHub, and voil√†, you're ready to dive into the world of intelligent agents. No secrets, just fun!

  Usage
The usage of this project is perfect for those who want to enrich their knowledge about AI and Agents. It's like training to become a Jedi master of programming. Jokes aside, it's a great way to see artificial intelligence in action and learn something new.

  Technologies Used:
  
-LANGCHAIN: Because only the strong understand the importance of good chains!
-PYTHON: The lingua franca of programmers (and snakes)!
-SQLite: The place where our data resides.
-OPENAI: The brain behind our smart agents.
-CHATGPT: Because talking to machines has never been so fun.

  -Contribution-
